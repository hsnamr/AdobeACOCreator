Create Adobe's .aco file from CIELAB or RGB colors

I might eventually add support for more colorspaces, or not, I tend to get bored easily and move on to something else and I also have a fulltime job.
No error checking or reporting is performed. If you think it is necessary you can add it yourself and share it back with me :-)
